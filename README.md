# Oppenheimer Project üèãÔ∏è.

The **Oppenheimer** is a personal iOS application project designed to simplify and enhance workout journaling. This app allows users to log, track, edit, and delete their workout sessions while maintaining record data using Core Data. Built with SwiftUI, this app features a clean and intuitive user interface, making it an ideal tool for those who track down their gym progress like myself.

## Features

- **Daily Workout Logging:**
    - Users can input key details such as date, workout split, duration, rating, and notes for their sessions. 
- **Dashboard View:**
    - Displays logged workouts with an organized summary including date, duration, and notes.
- **Data Persistence:**
    - All data is stored locally using Core Data, ensuring records remain available even after restarting the app.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift**: Primary programming language for iOS development.
- **SwiftUI**: Framework for building the app's user interface.
- **Core Data**: Framework for data persistence.

## Conclusion
This project has limitations due to the free provisioning profile, which requires re-deployment every 7 days as it is not registered in an Apple Developer membership. Despite this, the entire process of coming up with the idea and learning new technologies like Swift was challenging yet very much rewarding. I gained valuable technical knowledge, which has motivated me to explore other opportunities, and I look forward to creating even cooler things in the future.
